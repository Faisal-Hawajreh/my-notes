1. the purpose of the software is not to show off how intelligent you are. so you have to make your software simple and effective.

2. Your design should be easy for you and helpful for others.

3. be sure that you fully understand the systems and tools you are working with.

4. “How simple do you have to be?”
Here is your answer: Stupid, dumb simple.

5. Your main purpose is to control complexity, not to create it.

6. Maintenance is one of the most important things in software development. So don't ignore it.

7. Code that isn’t consistent becomes harder to understand. Don’t keep forcing developers to relearn the way your system works every time they look at a new piece of it.

8. The changes that will bring you a lot of value and require little effort are better than those that will bring little value and require a lot of effort.

9. To Solve Problems, you have to understand it, plan for it by analyze the problem and process the information, then divide it to small tasks to solve it.

10. the software doesn't have to be perfect, Good enough is fine.

11. Don’t predict to future. Be only as generic as you know you need to be right now.

12. Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future.

13. If you can automate it, automate it.

14. The optimum code is a small bunch of code that is easy to understand, easy to read.

15. Your main goal should be keeping your code base as small as possible. The question is not “How can I write more code?” rather it should be “How can I remove more code?”

16. When you test your code, you must execute all new lines at least once and you should start to test parts before the whole.

17. Break the big thing into smaller things. The smaller it is, the easier it is to estimate. You’re probably still going to get it wrong, but you’ll be a lot less wrong than if you estimated a big project.

18. Keep learning. Try out different programming languages and tools, read books on software development. They will give you another perspective. Every day small improvements will make a real difference in your knowledge and skills.

19. When you have tried everything, and preferably after you have a working solution, now is the best time to seek advice. Look to peers and senior developers to review your code
